# Breast Cancer Prediction 

The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify a tumor as benign or malignant based in the characteristics of the cell nuclei obtained of the digitized image of a FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy) of a breast mass. The data used for the project is available on [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data]
